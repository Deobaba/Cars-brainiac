# Security Implementations

### 1. CORS

The API is restricted to specific domains via CORS middleware. The allowed origins can be configured through environment variables for flexibility.(add your local url or deployed url to ALLOWED_ORIGINS )

### 2. Rate Limiting

To prevent DDoS attacks and brute-force attempts, rate-limiting restricts the number of requests a single IP can make in a given time window.

### 3. Helmet

Helmet adds security headers to protect the application from common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, and others.

# Error Handling

A global error handler catches all errors and logs them via Winston for traceability. Custom error classes ensure proper status codes and error messages are returned to clients

# Deploying to Heroku with GitHub Actions 

This project is configured to automatically deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) using GitHub Actions. The deployment process uses Docker to containerize the application and push it to Heroku's container registry. Additionally, PostgreSQL and Redis add-ons are set up to provide database and caching services.

## Prerequisites

1. A Heroku account and a Heroku application.
2. A GitHub repository for the project.


## Deployment Workflow

This repository is configured with a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys the application to Heroku whenever a PR is made to the `main` branch (or another branch if configured) and merged.

### Workflow Overview

The deployment workflow performs the following steps:

# Test and Deploy to Heroku Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the process of testing and deploying a Node.js application to Heroku whenever there is a push to the `main` branch.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Trigger:**  
   The workflow is triggered on a push event to the `main` branch.

2. **Job:**  
   The workflow contains a single job named `test-and-deploy`, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

3. **Steps:**

   - **Checkout Code:**  
     Utilizes the `actions/checkout@v2` action to check out the repository's code. This step ensures that the latest version of the code is available for subsequent steps.

   - **Set up Node.js:**  
     Uses `actions/setup-node@v2` to install and configure Node.js, specifying version 16. This ensures that the workflow runs in an environment that matches the projectâ€™s requirements.

   - **Install Dependencies:**  
     Runs `npm install` to install all necessary packages and dependencies for the project. This step is crucial for ensuring that the application can run and tests can be executed.

   - **Run Tests:**  
     Executes the test suite using `npm test`. The `CI: true` environment variable is set to ensure that Jest runs in CI mode, preventing accidental hangs during testing.

   - **Build the Project:**  
     Executes `npm run build` to build the project. This step compiles the application and prepares it for deployment.

   - **Deploy to Heroku:**  
     Uses the `akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.13.15` action to deploy the application to Heroku. The following parameters are used:
     - `heroku_app_name`: The name of your Heroku app, retrieved from GitHub Secrets.
     - `heroku_email`: Your Heroku account email, also retrieved from GitHub Secrets.
     - `heroku_api_key`: Your Heroku API key, securely accessed from GitHub Secrets.

## Summary
This workflow automates the critical steps of testing and deploying a Node.js application to Heroku, ensuring that your application is always up to date and functioning correctly after every push to the main branch. By leveraging GitHub Actions, you can maintain a streamlined development process and quickly respond to changes in your codebase.
